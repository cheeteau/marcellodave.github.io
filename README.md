# What is PPG Mod Creator
[PPG Mod Creator](https://cheeteau.github.io/PPG-Mod-Creator/) is a small mod creator that I created in my free time.
The purpose of this site is not to create mods that compete with the workshop mods, it's more for people who don't want to learn how to code for creating mods. So don't expect to be able to create incredible things.

And if you're crazy, you can contribute on the repo to help me clean the code, and have your name displayed on the helpers page on the website.
