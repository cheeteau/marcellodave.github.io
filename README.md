This most likely won't be updated by me (marcellodave, but i prefer to be called miiwii, but i'm not changing my username as it would probably cause some confusion!) as I do not have any coding knowledge, all I did was just reupload this cause the original link wasn't working anymore, but you can still do like pull requests or whatever they are called and if they add something that should've been added i'll merge it with the main branch or whatever its called

# What is PPG Mod Creator
PPG Mod Creator is a small mod creator that I created in my free time.
The purpose of this site is not to create mods that compete with the workshop mods, it's more for people who don't want to learn how to code for creating mods. So don't expect to be able to create incredible things.
